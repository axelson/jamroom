# Jamroom

In browser jamming!

## 

This is a Phoenix Live View application where you're performing for everyone on the website. You can choose an instrument and the notes you hit are broadcasto to everyone, complete with single frame animations! 

The amimations are a work in progress. I will make this look prettier! Once I find the time I will polish everything about this.

This project will be featured at Code Beam V where I'll be doing a tutorial on the various parts that make this up.
